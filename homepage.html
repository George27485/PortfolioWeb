   <div class="abt"> <h3 style="text-align:center">About</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center">Born and raised in Queens, New York, with a passion for learning and exploring new challenges. </p>
       <p style="text-align: center;"> In 2019, I earned a degree in psychology from Queens College, and have been pursuing a career in this field working with special needs children as a Behavioral Therapist. However, my interest in career has since shifted, and I have found my self seeking more knowledge and challenges - which has led me to the world of coding.</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;">I am a avid believer in hard work being the key to success, and because of that, you can find me working to strive higher everyday</p>
